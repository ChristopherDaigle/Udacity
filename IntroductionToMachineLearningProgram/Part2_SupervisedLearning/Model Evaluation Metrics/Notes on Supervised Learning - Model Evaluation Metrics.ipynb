    "> **Step 9:** Using the fbeta_score works similar to most of the other metrics in sklearn, but you also need to set beta as your weighting between precision and recall.  Use the space below to show that you can use [fbeta in sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score.html) to replicate your f1-score from above.  If in the future you want to use a different weighting, [this article](http://mlwiki.org/index.php/Precision_and_Recall) does an amazing job of explaining how you might adjust beta for different situations."
