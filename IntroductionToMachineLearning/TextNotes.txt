What is machine learning?
  Teaching computers to learn to perform tasks from past experiences
  - Experiences are data

Hotkeys for Jupyter Notebook:

Retina display visualizations: %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'
    after %matplotlib inline

Debugging is possible too - %pdb and to quit type q in the prompt

Jupyter Notebooks are JSON files
- they can be converted in the terminal with the command:
    <jupyer nbconvert --to html notebook.ipynb>
    <jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to slides>
